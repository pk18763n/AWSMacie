# AWSMacie

This is a simple python file to extract and save the findings from AWS Macies into a Json file. Currently, AWS Macie console only shows 25 findings on console and you have to repeatedly scroll down to see all the findings and then only you can extract and download them. This approach is not feasible if you have more than 15K findings and you need to extract all of them. The python script will do that for you :-)

PS:- I am not a seasonal coder, but the scripts works somehow :-P
